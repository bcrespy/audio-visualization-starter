# Audio visualization starter kit

This project was created to provide a powerful and flexible solution to creative audio visualization applications. You may want to use it if you're only focused on creating visuals and you don't want to invest time in beat detection algorithms. It bundles a few modules that allows you to only focus on interpreting analysed audio data. Here are examples that I made using this project as a core:

* [A simple 2D canvas visualizer](http://crespy-baptiste.com/repo/simple-visualizer/)
* [2D particles reacting to a beat](http://crespy-baptiste.com/repo/2d-particles-booming/)
* [3D fractals "dive-in", based on Barry Martin's Hopalong Orbits Visualizer](http://crespy-baptiste.com/repo/fractals-dive-in/)

This is what you will get if you run this project as it is right now:
